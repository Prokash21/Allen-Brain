# Allen Brain  analysis and visualization

This repository contains notebooks and scripts used for exploring and visualizing Allen Institute datasets and related electrophysiology / Patch-seq examples. It collects code and generated figures for cell-type analyses, Patch-seq metrics, and electrophysiology demonstrations.

## Quick start

- Create a Python environment (recommended: venv or conda)
- Install dependencies:

```powershell
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

- Run example scripts (from the repository root):

```powershell
python scripts/run_all_scripts.py
# or run individual scripts under `scripts/` or `scripts/<subfolder>/`
```

## Notable files

- `requirements.txt`  minimal packages used by notebooks and scripts.
- `scripts/`  runnable Python scripts that mirror many of the analyses in the notebooks.
- `*.ipynb`  Jupyter notebooks with interactive analysis and plots (see top-level folders like `allen_25`, `cell_type`, `electroscopy`).

## How this README was generated

This README was populated to provide a concise overview and to embed the project's generated figures (located in the `figures/` folder). If you generate new figures, add them to `figures/` and update this README or enable a script to regenerate the README automatically.
